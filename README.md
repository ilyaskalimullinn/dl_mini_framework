# DL mini-framework

Mini-framework based on [HSE homework](https://github.com/isadrtdinov/intro-to-dl-hse/tree/2022-2023/homeworks-small/shw-01-mlp)

I have implemented some modules that are used in Deep Learning:

- Layers:
  - Linear
  - Batch Normalization
  - Dropout Layer
  - Sequential Container
- Activations:
  - ReLU
  - Sigmoid
  - Softmax
  - Logsoftmax
- Criterions:
  - MSE Loss
  - Cross Entropy Loss
- Optimizers:
  - SGD
  - Adam
- Dataloader

There is also a notebook `tests.ipynb` where I show that all automatic tests from the original task pass. Moreover, I have created a notebook `linear_showcase.ipynb` where I train a small model using these components
